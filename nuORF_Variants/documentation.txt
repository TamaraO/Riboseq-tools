The scripts here include the analysis pipeline for variant incorporation into ORFs, determination of variant coverage across multiple sequencing datasets, combination with translation quantification, and neoantigen prediction. 

The scripts should be executed in the following order:

1. variant_pipeline.sh which incorporates:
    1. variant_to_protein_gatk_only.py
    2. variant_analysis.py
    3. split_fasta.py (generate peptides)
    4. mutation_protein_coordinates.py
2. snv_coverage.sh (runs snv_coverage.py)
3. coverage_across_samples.ipynb
4. Run variant_peptides.sh (runs variant_peptides.py)
5. neoantigen_analysis_snv.ipynb (generates potential neoantigens)
