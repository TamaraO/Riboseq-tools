# Riboseq-tools

Here you will find the tools for:
- orfMerge: Condensing RibORF and PRICE ORF predictions to construct nuORFdb
- rpfTPM: Quantifying ORF translation, accounting for translation frame and multimapping reads
- MassSpecMapping: Mapping peptide sequences identified by mass spectrometry to the most likely protein origin
- nuORF_Variants: Incorporating cancer-specific somatic variants into ORFs and identifying potential neoantigens
