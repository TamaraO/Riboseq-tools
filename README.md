# Riboseq-tools

Here you will find the tools for:
- Condensing RibORF and PRICE ORF predictions to construct nuORFdb
- Quantifying ORF translation, accounting for translation frame and multimapping reads
- Mapping peptide sequences identified by mass spectrometry to the most likely origin
- Incorporating cancer-specific somatic variants into ORFs and identifying potential neoantigens
